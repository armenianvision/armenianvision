## Preamble

Armenian civilization, with roots reaching deep into the ancient history of the Armenian Highlands, proclaims its mission to be a center of inter-civilizational dialogue and a representative of the autochthonous peoples of the region. Located at the geostrategic crossroads of East and West, North and South, Armenia strives to restore its civilizational identity based on centuries-old historical heritage, in order to strengthen statehood, preserve cultural wealth, and take a worthy place in global processes. We, the heirs of Urartu, Greater Armenia, and the creator of the alphabet Mesrop Mashtots, call for the formation of a new humanism where differences become a source of harmony rather than conflict.

## Fundamental Principles of Armenian Civilization

### 1. Civilizational Identity as the Foundation of Stability

Armenian civilization possesses historical continuity dating back to the 9th century BCE (the states of Urartu and Greater Armenia). Despite conquests and the tragedy of the 1915 Genocide, the Armenian ethnos has preserved its language, culture, and spiritual tradition. The formation of civilizational identity, as emphasized in the research of S. Huntington and A. Toynbee, is necessary for the consolidation of the Armenian people, including the diaspora and Artsakh, and for increasing resilience to external challenges.

### 2. The Role of Bridge Between Civilizations

Armenia's geopolitical position on the "fault line" (S. Huntington) makes it a natural mediator between East and West, North and South. Historically, Armenia facilitated cultural and trade exchange, preserving ancient texts and developing diplomatic ties with Rome, Byzantium, and Parthia. Today, Armenia is called to become a neutral platform for dialogue between civilizational projects such as Turan, the Arab world, China, Iran, Russia, and the West.

### 3. Christian Spirituality and Interfaith Tolerance

The adoption of Christianity in 301 CE by King Trdat III made the Armenian Apostolic Church the spiritual and cultural center of the nation. The philosophical schools of Tatev and Gladzor laid the foundations of Armenian scholasticism. At the same time, Armenia has historically demonstrated tolerance toward other religions, coexisting with Yazidis, Assyrians, and other communities. This openness allows Armenia to serve as a moderator of interfaith dialogue while preserving its Christian identity.

### 4. Family and Traditional Values

The family remains the cornerstone of Armenian civilization. Traditional roles of men and women harmoniously combine with respect for their social significance. Respect for the elder generation and care for children as the future of the nation strengthen social stability. Armenian civilization protects the family from ideological pressure, preserving it as the foundation of society while remaining open to progress.

### 5. Cultural Heritage and Creative Development

Armenian culture includes unique achievements: the alphabet of Mesrop Mashtots (405 CE), the architecture of Etchmiadzin and Zvartnots, the art of khachkars recognized by UNESCO, and a rich musical tradition (sharakans, the epic "David of Sassoun"). Education, oriented toward national values and integrated into the global noosphere, should develop creativity and ensure cooperation with other cultures. The Matenadaran with its 17,000 manuscripts and the scholarly works of Anania Shirakatsi and Mkhitar Heratsi confirm Armenia's intellectual contribution to world civilization.

### 6. Representation of Autochthonous Peoples

Armenian civilization unites Armenians as the principal ethnos and the autochthonous peoples of the Armenian Highlands, including Yazidis, Assyrians, Ayrums, Kurdish groups, and others. Armenia strives to become a defender of the rights and cultural heritage of the small peoples of the region in international organizations such as UNESCO and the UN, continuing the tradition of supporting religious and ethnic minorities.

### 7. Creative Education and Connection with the World

We aspire to education that combines Armenian traditions with the achievements of the global noosphere. Our educational system should be oriented toward developing creativity, preserving civilizational identity, and actively interacting with the global information field. Armenian civilization is open to cooperation with other cultures but does not detach itself from its roots.

### 8. New Humanism and Creative Mission

Armenian civilization offers a model of harmonious coexistence where differences between cultures and religions are perceived as the wealth of the world. According to K. Zaryan, Armenia is a "ship on a mountain," called to become the "Prometheus of the coming era." This creative mission excludes expansionism and focuses on cultural attraction and peaceful dialogue.

## Strategic Vision

Armenian civilization positions the modern Armenian state as the center of the Armenian world, uniting Armenia, Artsakh, the diaspora, and autochthonous peoples. Key directions of development include:

• Creating international forums and cultural tourism programs to strengthen Armenia's role as a moderator of inter-civilizational dialogue.

• Developing education that combines national identity with global knowledge.

• Protecting the cultural heritage of the Armenian Highlands through international organizations.

• Forming a transnational network of the Armenian world where culture and identity transcend territorial boundaries.

## Conclusion

Armenian civilization, drawing upon its centuries-old heritage, offers the world a creative model of development. The formation of civilizational ideology will strengthen the unity of the Armenian people, increase state resilience, and allow Armenia to become a center of intercultural and interfaith dialogue. We call upon the Armenian people, the diaspora, and all who share our values to unite efforts for the realization of this mission and the construction of a future where Armenia will become a symbol of harmony and new humanism.
